**Arguments:**
• what: (required) either "cells", "fields" or "statements" to show the current values of those aspects of application state
• filters: an object with the keys set to the names and values being `false` to hide the named item from the table
• clear: `true` to clear the console before printing the table
• label: a string label for this show process, can be used the the `stop` command to discontinue live updates. Must be present in order to use the `run` argument.
• run: `true` to create a live updating table in the console which automatically updates whenever a tracked value changes. Best used with `clear` being true and requires a `label` set so that it can be stopped later.
